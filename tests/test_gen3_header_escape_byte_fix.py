"""
Tests for the Gen3 header escape-byte fix (queue item 23,
analysis/gen3_header_escape_byte_fix.md).

get_version_and_header()'s REV3 branch read Board rev./Firmware rev./
Firmware build from fixed whole-file byte offsets taken directly from
the raw file bytes, with no concept of the entry-level byte-stuffing
(BinaryTools.unescape_block) every real entry decoder in this parser
already accounts for. A literal 0xfe escape byte anywhere in the entry
before those offsets silently shifted what got read there - confirmed
on 7 real files, all misreading Board rev./Firmware rev. as 0/0.

Fix: get_version_and_header() now also tries entry type 0xfb's own
decode (Gen2.mbb_system_information(), reused directly rather than
duplicated) when byte 0 is 0xb2, and prefers its VIN/Model/Board rev./
Firmware rev. when it succeeds. Firmware build is left exactly as the
fixed-offset method computes it either way, since the entry decoder
doesn't read that field.

Real samples: truncated real files (first 140 bytes, enough to cover
every fixed offset this function reads, hex-embedded the same way
tests/test_type_0xfb_system_information.py embeds message bytes).
Synthetic samples reuse test_gen3_header_decode.py's build_gen3_buffer
helper for the "override must decline" cases, the same convention
that file already established.
