"""
Tests for Gen2._withhold_marker_corrupted_fields, the generic per-field
corruption detection this repo added after analysis/
decode_coverage_partials_and_marker.md found that types 0x4B/0x4C/0x4D's
decoded fields can silently read bytes the 00 f0 ff 00 page marker
overwrote. See analysis/marker_masking_and_duplicate_entries.md (an
earlier session's own name for that investigation, unchanged here). These
values are corrupted: the marker overwrote the original bytes, so the
value cannot be recovered or verified, matching this repo's existing
bytes_corrupted / corrupted_byte_count convention for entry-level
corruption.

Same conventions as test_fst_page_aware_walker.py: plain test_* functions,
stdlib only, synthetic in-process buffers built with the same _entry/_fill
helpers, Gen2.collect_paged_bms_entries called directly rather than through
a full synthetic file where a test does not need header/log-type detection
too.
